# Solutions to the Advent of Code 2017

https://adventofcode.com/

The Advent of Code (AoC) is a yearly game that goes through programming puzzles. 
It's fun to do, and keeps those programming chops sharp.

By creating a repo and posting solution code each day, I am hoping I can stick to 
following through with each one. Quick and dirty is the name of the game here.

Wish me luck!
